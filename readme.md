aka Subscribe-Publish or Delegate-Model pattern

Underlying the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern is the observer pattern.
An object, called the subject, maintains a list of observers that and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

A nosy class wants to know when another object does something interesting. The curious class defined by the Observer interface. Loose coupling, ie the Subjects don't need to know anything about the observers/listeners.
